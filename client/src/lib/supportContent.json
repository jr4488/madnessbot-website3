Here's the procedure:\n1. Turn ignition to ON (don't start engine)\n2. Press and hold the SELECT/RESET button on the steering wheel\n3. Hold for about 10 seconds until the oil life resets to 100%\n4. Turn off ignition\n\nThat's it! Takes 15 seconds. 👍\n```\n\n**Complex Diagnostic:**\n```\nYou: 2018 F-150 5.0L, P0171 and P0174 codes, rough idle, no vacuum leaks found\n\nMadness: 🔍 **Dual Bank Lean Codes - F-150 5.0L**\n\nBoth banks lean with no vacuum leaks? Let's dig deeper...\n\n**Most Likely Causes:**\n1. **MAF sensor contamination** (70% probability)\n   - Check for oil on sensor element\n   - Test: Unplug MAF, if idle improves = bad MAF\n   \n2. **Fuel pressure issue** (20%)\n   - Spec: 55-65 PSI at idle\n   - Check fuel filter (often overlooked)\n   \n3. **PCV system restriction** (10%)\n   - Check PCV valve and hoses\n\n**Diagnostic Steps:**\n1. Clean MAF with CRC MAF cleaner ($8.99)\n2. Check fuel pressure with gauge\n3. Inspect PCV system\n\n**Parts You Might Need:**\n- [Motorcraft MAF Sensor - $89.99](link)\n- [Fuel Filter - $24.99](link)\n\nWhat's your fuel pressure reading?\n```\n\n### Understanding Madness's Responses\n\nMadness always formats responses with:\n- **🔧 Bold headings** for main topics\n- **Bullet points** for lists and steps\n- **Emojis** for visual clarity 🚗⚙️🔍\n- **Clickable links** for parts (in blue)\n- **Step-by-step procedures** numbered clearly\n\n### Continuing the Conversation\n\n**MadnessBot remembers everything in your conversation!**\n\nYou can:\n- Ask follow-up questions\n- Request clarification\n- Go deeper into diagnostics\n- Switch topics (Madness tracks it all)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: What's your fuel pressure reading?\n\nMadness: I'm seeing 52 PSI at idle\n\nYou: That's a bit low. Spec is 55-65. Check your fuel filter first - \nit's cheap and often the culprit. If pressure is still low after \nfilter replacement, you're looking at a weak fuel pump.\n\nLabor time: 0.5 hours for filter, 2.5 hours for pump.\n```\n\n---"

Aquí está el procedimiento:\n1. Gire el encendido a ON (no arranque el motor)\n2. Mantenga presionado el botón SELECT/RESET en el volante\n3. Mantenga presionado durante unos 10 segundos hasta que la vida útil del aceite se restablezca al 100%\n4. Apague el encendido\n\n¡Eso es todo! Tarda 15 segundos. 👍\n```\n\n**Diagnóstico Complejo:**\n```\nYou: 2018 F-150 5.0L, P0171 and P0174 codes, rough idle, no vacuum leaks found\n\nMadness: 🔍 **Códigos de Mezcla Pobre en Ambos Bancos - F-150 5.0L**\n\n¿Mezcla pobre en ambos bancos sin fugas de vacío? Profundicemos...\n\n**Causas Más Probables:**\n1. **Contaminación del sensor MAF** (70% de probabilidad)\n   - Verifique si hay aceite en el elemento sensor\n   - Prueba: Desconecte el MAF, si el ralentí mejora = MAF defectuoso\n   \n2. **Problema de presión de combustible** (20%)\n   - Especificación: 55-65 PSI en ralentí\n   - Verifique el filtro de combustible (a menudo se pasa por alto)\n   \n3. **Restricción del sistema PCV** (10%)\n   - Verifique la válvula PCV y las mangueras\n\n**Pasos de Diagnóstico:**\n1. Limpie el MAF con limpiador CRC MAF ($8.99)\n2. Verifique la presión de combustible con un manómetro\n3. Inspeccione el sistema PCV\n\n**Piezas que Podría Necesitar:**\n- [Sensor MAF Motorcraft - $89.99](link)\n- [Filtro de Combustible - $24.99](link)\n\nWhat's your fuel pressure reading?\n```\n\n### Entendiendo las Respuestas de Madness\n\nMadness siempre formatea las respuestas con:\n- **🔧 Encabezados en negrita** para los temas principales\n- **Viñetas** para listas y pasos\n- **Emojis** para claridad visual 🚗⚙️🔍\n- **Enlaces clicables** para piezas (en azul)\n- **Procedimientos paso a paso** numerados claramente\n\n### Continuar la Conversación\n\n**¡MadnessBot recuerda todo en su conversación!**\n\nUsted puede:\n- Hacer preguntas de seguimiento\n- Solicitar aclaraciones\n- Profundizar en los diagnósticos\n- Cambiar de tema (Madness rastrea todo)\n\n**Ejemplo:**\n```\nYou: What's your fuel pressure reading?\n\nMadness: I'm seeing 52 PSI at idle\n\nYou: That's a bit low. Spec is 55-65. Check your fuel filter first - \nit's cheap and often the culprit. If pressure is still low after \nfilter replacement, you're looking at a weak fuel pump.\n\nLabor time: 0.5 hours for filter, 2.5 hours for pump.\n```\n\n---"

Siempre sepa lo que tiene.**\n\n### Comprobación de Su Inventario\n\n**Pídale a Madness que le muestre qué herramientas posee:**\n\n```\nYou: What tools do I have?\nYou: Show my inventory\nYou: List my tools\n```\n\n**Madness responderá con:**\n```\n🔧 **Su Inventario Actual de Herramientas**\n\n**Herramientas Manuales (Hand Tools):**\n- Juego de dados (socket set), de 3/8\" (1) - notas: falta el de 15mm\n- Juego de dados (socket set), de 1/2\" (1)\n- Llave dinamométrica (Torque wrench), 10-150 ft-lbs (1)\n- Juego de destornilladores (Screwdriver set), Phillips/cabeza plana (1)\n\n**Herramientas Especializadas (Specialty Tools):**\n- Herramienta para pinzas de freno (Brake caliper tool) (1)\n- Probador de compresión (Compression tester) (1)\n- Pistola estroboscópica de sincronización (Timing light) (1)\n\n**Herramientas Eléctricas (Power Tools):**\n- Llave de impacto (Impact wrench), de 1/2\" (2) - notas: una en el área de trabajo 3\n\nTotal: 9 herramientas rastreadas\n```\n\n### Comprobación de Si Tiene Todo para un Trabajo\n\n**La característica más potente: pregunte ANTES de empezar:**\n\n```\nYou: Do I have everything to replace a timing belt on a 2018 Honda Accord?\n```\n\n**Madness comprueba su inventario y responde:**\n```\n🔧 **Verificación de Herramientas: Correa de Distribución (Timing Belt) de un Honda Accord 2018**\n\n**✅ Ya Tiene:**\n- Juego de dados (3/8\" y 1/2\")\n- Llave dinamométrica (10-150 ft-lbs)\n- Destornilladores (Phillips y cabeza plana)\n- Gato de piso y soportes de gato (jack stands)\n\n**❌ Le Faltan:**\n- Extractor de polea del cigüeñal (Harmonic balancer puller)\n- Herramienta de sujeción del árbol de levas (Camshaft holding tool) (específica de Honda)\n- Calibrador de tensión de la correa de distribución (Timing belt tension gauge)\n\n¿Quiere que añada estos a su inventario?\n```\n\n**Esto le evita:**\n- Empezar un trabajo y descubrir que le faltan herramientas\n- Tener que hacer viajes de emergencia por piezas\n- Perder horas facturables\n- Retrasos con el cliente\n\n### Adición de Herramientas a Su Inventario\n\n**Tres maneras de añadir herramientas:**\n\n#### Método 1: Añadir Herramientas Faltantes (El más fácil)\nDespués de que Madness le muestre lo que le falta:\n```\nYou: Yes, add the missing tools\nYou: Add them all\nYou: Add those to my inventory\n```\n\n¡Madness añade todo a la vez!\n\n#### Método 2: Añadir Herramientas Individuales\n```\nYou: Add a brake bleeder kit to my inventory\nYou: I just bought a torque wrench, add it\nYou: Add compression tester\n```\n\n#### Método 3: Añadir con Detalles\n```\nYou: Add a torque wrench, 10-150 ft-lbs, note: needs calibration by March 15\n```\n\n**Madness confirma:**\n```\n✅ **Inventario Actualizado**\n\nAñadido:\n- Extractor de polea del cigüeñal (1)\n- Herramienta de sujeción del árbol de levas, específica de Honda (1)\n- Calibrador de tensión de la correa de distribución (1)\n\nSu inventario ahora tiene 12 herramientas.\n```\n\n### Eliminación de Herramientas\n\n**Si vendió, perdió o prestó una herramienta:**\n\n```\nYou: Remove the brake bleeder from my inventory\nYou: I loaned out my compression tester, remove it\nYou: Delete the old torque wrench\n```\n\n### Actualización de Cantidades\n\n**Si tiene varias unidades de algo:**\n\n```\nYou: I have 3 impact wrenches, update quantity\nYou: Set impact wrench quantity to 3\n```\n\n### Adición de Notas\n\n**Rastree detalles importantes:**\n\n```\nYou: Add note to torque wrench: needs calibration\nYou: Note on compression tester: borrowed to bay 3\nYou: Update impact wrench note: one is broken, needs repair\n```\n\n### Mejores Prácticas para el Inventario de Herramientas\n\n1. **Añada herramientas a medida que las compre** - Tarda 5 segundos\n2. **Verifique antes de comenzar trabajos grandes** - Ahorra horas\n3. **Use notas para información importante** - Fechas de calibración, ubicaciones, estado\n4. **Actualice cuando preste herramientas** - Sepa dónde está todo\n5. **Auditorías regulares** - \"Show my inventory\" una vez al mes\n\n**Consejo Profesional (Pro Tip):** Si es un taller con varios técnicos, cada persona tiene su propio inventario. ¡Sus herramientas no se mezclarán con las de otros!\n\n---"
